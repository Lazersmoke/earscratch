# Ear Scratch

[Live link](https://lazersmoke.github.io/earscratch/)

It's like [Ear Sketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/) but we steal all their samples and do it in like 200 lines of code.

Try copy pasting one the Ear Sketch competition winners' [source code](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/#?sharing=qWVBhDEjgIIi7BiiXMJZUQ) into the left box, then Run Code and Play.
